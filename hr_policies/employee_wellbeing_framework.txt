EMPLOYEE WELLBEING AND BURNOUT FRAMEWORK
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources & People Analytics
Classification: Company‑Wide Framework

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This framework connects multiple HR policies into a single model for detecting, preventing, and responding to burnout and wellbeing risks. It links workload, flexible work, recognition, mental health support, and performance management.

It applies to all employees and is intended to guide managers, HR, and leadership in day‑to‑day decisions.

2. EARLY‑RISK SIGNALS
Managers and HR should monitor the following objective signals:
- Sustained weekly hours > 48 over 4+ weeks
- Self‑reported stress ≥ 7/10 in two consecutive measurements
- Sudden or sustained drop in performance or quality from a previously reliable employee
- Pattern of unplanned absences and sick days
- Noticeable withdrawal from collaboration or behavior changes

If at least two signals are present, the employee is considered “At‑Risk” and a wellbeing check‑in is required.

3. WELLBEING CHECK‑IN PROCESS
3.1 Timing
A wellbeing check‑in must be scheduled within 5 business days after risk signals trigger.

3.2 Conversation Structure
Managers should:
- Open with a neutral, supportive question about how work and life are going
- Ask about workload, priorities, and constraints
- Avoid judgmental language or assumptions
- Explain that the purpose is support, not discipline
- Discuss concrete options (flexible work, workload changes, EAP, leave, development support)

3.3 Documentation
Managers document:
- Date of conversation
- Main issues discussed (in non‑clinical language)
- Agreed actions and timelines
- Date of follow‑up

Notes are stored in secure HR systems with limited access.

4. INTERVENTION LEVELS
The framework uses three levels, aligned with the Burnout Prevention Policy.

4.1 Level 1 – Light Adjustment
Used when risk is emerging but performance is still largely intact.

Typical actions:
- Clarify priorities; postpone/de‑scope lower‑value tasks
- Block recurring focus time in the calendar
- Encourage taking existing PTO or mental health days
- Adjust meeting load where possible

4.2 Level 2 – Structured Support Plan
Used when burnout risk is clearly affecting performance or wellbeing.

Typical components:
- Temporary cap on weekly hours and overtime
- Clear boundaries on after‑hours communication
- Short‑term flexible or hybrid work arrangement
- Planned use of EAP or coaching
- Weekly or bi‑weekly check‑ins over 4–8 weeks

4.3 Level 3 – Formal Leave or Role Change
Used when the employee cannot sustain current work safely.

Options:
- Burnout recovery or medical leave under Leave and Time‑Off Policy
- Temporary or permanent move to lower‑intensity work
- Reduced hours or part‑time schedule

Level 3 actions require HR involvement and leadership awareness.

5. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Employees:
- Speak up early when workload or stress becomes unsustainable.
- Participate actively in agreed support plans.
- Use available programs (EAP, PTO, flexible work) as needed.

Managers:
- Monitor risk signals using accessible data and observation.
- Conduct wellbeing check‑ins promptly.
- Apply intervention levels consistently and without bias.
- Escalate to HR early when patterns emerge across multiple team members.

HR and People Analytics:
- Provide dashboards and reports on key risk indicators (e.g., hours, absence, engagement).
- Train managers and leaders on interpreting data and having constructive conversations.
- Identify structural or systemic causes (e.g., staffing, targets, incentives) and recommend fixes.

Leadership:
- Set realistic expectations for pace, deadlines, and growth.
- Ensure staffing and resources match business goals.
- Reinforce that sustainable performance is a strategic priority, not a “nice to have”.

6. DATA AND ANALYTICS
The company may use aggregated data to identify risk patterns, such as:
- Work hours and overtime trends
- Absence and attrition patterns
- Engagement, wellbeing, and manager‑effectiveness survey results
- Usage of EAP, flexible work, and leave (anonymized where required)

Use of individual‑level data is limited to supportive interventions and must comply with privacy laws and internal data protection standards.

7. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES
This framework supports and does not replace:
- Mental Health and Wellness Policy
- Burnout Prevention Policy
- Flexible Work and Work‑Life Balance Policy
- Leave and Time‑Off Policy
- Performance Management and Feedback practices

In case of conflict, formal policies and applicable laws take precedence.
