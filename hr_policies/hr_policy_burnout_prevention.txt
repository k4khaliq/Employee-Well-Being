EMPLOYEE WELLBEING AND BURNOUT PREVENTION POLICY
Version: 2.6
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources
Classification: Company‑Wide Policy

1. PURPOSE
This policy explains how the company detects, prevents, and responds to burnout risk. It defines early indicators, intervention levels, workload rules, and the link between flexibility, recognition, and sustainable performance.

2. DEFINITIONS
- Burnout: A work‑related state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, typically involving exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced effectiveness.
- At‑Risk Employee: An employee who meets defined indicators of elevated burnout risk. This is a workplace risk concept, not a clinical diagnosis.

3. EARLY‑RISK INDICATORS
Managers and HR should watch for:
- Sustained weekly hours > 48 over a rolling 4‑week period
- Self‑reported stress ≥ 7/10 in two consecutive check‑ins or surveys
- Noticeable decline in engagement, responsiveness, or work quality
- Increased unplanned absences, missed deadlines, or frequent errors
- Withdrawal from collaboration or unusual irritability

If at least two indicators are present, the manager must schedule a wellbeing check‑in.

4. WELLBEING CHECK‑IN
4.1 Timing
The wellbeing check‑in should occur within 5 business days of identifying risk indicators.

4.2 Conversation
The manager must:
- Hold a private, uninterrupted meeting
- Ask open questions about workload, priorities, and capacity
- Listen at least as much as they speak
- Explain available options (flexible work, workload changes, EAP, leave, development adjustments)
- Agree on next steps and a follow‑up date

4.3 Documentation
The manager documents:
- Date of check‑in
- Main themes (no clinical detail)
- Actions agreed and timelines
- Follow‑up date

Records are stored in the HR/performance system with restricted access.

5. INTERVENTION LEVELS
5.1 Level 1 – Light Adjustment
Used when stress is elevated but still manageable.

Examples:
- Reprioritizing tasks and dropping low‑impact work
- Clarifying expectations and removing conflicting priorities
- Blocking 2–4 hours per week as focus time
- Encouraging use of PTO or mental health days

5.2 Level 2 – Structured Support Plan
Used when burnout risk clearly affects performance or wellbeing.

Plan may include:
- Temporary cap on weekly hours and overtime
- Clear boundaries on after‑hours communication
- Short‑term flexible or hybrid work arrangements
- Expected use of EAP or coaching
- Weekly or bi‑weekly check‑ins over 4–8 weeks

The plan is documented and agreed by employee, manager, and HR.

5.3 Level 3 – Formal Leave or Role Change
Used when the employee cannot safely maintain current responsibilities.

Options:
- Burnout recovery or medical leave as defined in Leave and Time‑Off Policy
- Temporary or permanent reassignment to a lower‑intensity role
- Reduced or part‑time schedule, with HR and leadership approval

All Level 3 actions require HR review and documentation.

6. WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT RULES
- Overtime is exceptional, not routine, and should normally be capped at 10 hours per week.
- Managers review team workloads at least monthly.
- No employee should carry more than three major concurrent critical projects without explicit senior approval.
- After peak workload periods, managers should schedule recovery time where possible (lighter weeks, reduced meetings, or additional time off).

7. RECOGNITION AND ENGAGEMENT
To reduce burnout risk, managers should:
- Give specific, timely recognition for meaningful contributions
- Share context so employees understand impact, not just tasks
- Involve employees in prioritization and decision‑making where practical

Teams with consistently low recognition or unclear goals are considered higher‑risk for burnout and should be flagged to HR.

8. FLEXIBLE WORK LINKAGE
Burnout prevention is closely tied to flexible work practices. Managers should consider:
- Adjusting working hours
- Increasing remote or hybrid days where feasible
- Using compressed weeks or temporary reduced hours in intense periods
- Discouraging after‑hours email and chat expectations

All decisions must align with the Flexible Work & Work‑Life Balance Policy and business requirements.

9. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Employees:
- Raise concerns early when workload or stress is unsustainable.
- Participate honestly in wellbeing discussions and support plans.
- Use available tools (EAP, PTO, flexible work) responsibly.

Managers:
- Monitor early indicators and act quickly when risk appears.
- Apply intervention levels consistently and fairly.
- Partner with HR to address structural workload issues.
- Model healthy behavior and respect boundaries.

HR and Leadership:
- Provide training, analytics, and tools to support burnout prevention.
- Review trends across departments and remove systemic causes (e.g., chronic understaffing, conflicting targets).
- Ensure policies and incentive structures do not reward unhealthy overwork.

10. MEASUREMENT AND REVIEW
The company may use anonymized and aggregated data to track burnout risk trends, including:
- Work hours and overtime patterns
- Absence, attrition, and engagement scores
- Use of wellbeing and flexible work programs

Insights are used to improve policies and practices, not to punish individuals. HR reviews this policy every two years or after major organizational changes.
