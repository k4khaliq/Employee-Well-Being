FLEXIBLE WORK AND WORK‑LIFE BALANCE POLICY
Version: 3.0
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources
Classification: Company‑Wide Policy

1. PURPOSE
This policy describes how employees may work flexibly in terms of location and schedule. It aims to support wellbeing and productivity while maintaining service quality, security, and fairness.

2. PRINCIPLES
- Flexibility is considered where role and business needs allow.
- Outcomes and results matter more than presence or screen time.
- Boundaries and disconnection are essential for sustainable performance.
- Decisions must be transparent and based on objective criteria, not favoritism.

3. TYPES OF FLEXIBLE WORK
Subject to role suitability and approval, options may include:
- Hybrid work: regular mix of office and remote days
- Fully remote work: for roles and jurisdictions that support it
- Flexible hours: varying start and end times within defined core hours
- Compressed workweeks: e.g., four longer days instead of five standard days
- Temporary reduced hours or part‑time arrangements

Specific implementation guidance (e.g., eligible roles, core hours) is provided in HR procedures.

4. ELIGIBILITY AND APPROVAL
- Eligibility is based on role requirements, performance, team needs, and legal constraints.
- Employees submit a written request describing their proposed arrangement and rationale.
- Managers review requests with HR, considering:
  - Customer and operational impact
  - Team collaboration needs
  - Security and regulatory requirements
  - Fairness across comparable roles

Decisions and reasons must be communicated clearly to the employee and recorded.

5. RIGHT TO DISCONNECT
To protect wellbeing and prevent overwork:
- Employees are not expected to respond to messages outside agreed working hours, except for clearly defined emergency roles.
- Recurring meetings should be scheduled within core working hours and take time zones into account.
- Tools such as delayed send should be used to avoid creating pressure outside normal hours.

Managers must model healthy behavior by respecting boundaries and not rewarding “always on” patterns.

6. PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Flexible work does not reduce performance expectations or security obligations.

Employees working flexibly must:
- Be reachable and responsive during agreed working times
- Maintain service quality and meet agreed objectives
- Keep calendars and status indicators accurate and up to date

Managers must:
- Set clear goals and success measures
- Provide regular feedback based on results, not visibility
- Address performance or behavioral issues promptly and fairly

7. WELLBEING AND BURNOUT PREVENTION
Flexible work is a key tool in burnout prevention and should be considered in line with the Burnout Prevention Policy, especially when:
- Employees are recovering from intense project periods
- Caregiving responsibilities increase temporarily
- Early burnout indicators are present and workload needs adjusting

8. REVIEW AND CHANGES
This policy is reviewed at least every two years, or sooner when business models, technology, or legal requirements significantly change.
