LEAVE AND TIME‑OFF POLICY (WELLBEING FOCUS)
Version: 2.6
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources
Classification: Company‑Wide Policy

1. PURPOSE
This policy explains how employees can take time away from work for rest, health, family needs, and recovery, with emphasis on mental health and burnout prevention.

2. PAID TIME OFF (PTO)
- PTO is intended for rest, personal time, and vacation.
- Employees are encouraged to use a substantial portion of their annual PTO each year.
- PTO should be requested in advance where possible and approved based on coverage and business needs.
- Managers must not reward “never taking PTO” as a sign of commitment.

3. SICK LEAVE AND MENTAL HEALTH DAYS
- Sick leave may be used for physical or mental health needs.
- Where available, designated mental health days can be taken without disclosing detailed reasons; a simple health‑related justification is sufficient.
- Medical documentation may be requested for extended absences, subject to local law and internal rules.

4. BURNOUT RECOVERY OR WELLBEING LEAVE
Where local law and company benefits allow:
- Employees experiencing significant work‑related stress or burnout, confirmed by a health professional or EAP counselor, may access dedicated wellbeing leave or medical leave.
- This leave may be partially or fully paid depending on jurisdiction and benefit design.
- Job protection and return‑to‑work support are provided as described in the Mental Health and Wellness Policy.

5. PARENTAL, FAMILY, AND BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
The company provides leave for:
- Birth, adoption, or fostering of a child, as defined in parental leave provisions
- Caring for seriously ill close family members where allowed
- Bereavement following the death of a close family member or significant person

Details (duration, pay, eligibility) are documented in the full Leave and Time‑Off handbook and may vary by country.

6. UNPAID PERSONAL LEAVE
Employees may request unpaid leave for:
- Family responsibilities
- Education or development
- Personal health matters not covered elsewhere
- Other serious personal circumstances

Requests are evaluated by HR and management on a case‑by‑case basis, considering operational impact and legal obligations.

7. RETURN‑TO‑WORK AFTER EXTENDED LEAVE
After extended leave, especially for health or burnout:
- HR and the manager will agree a transition plan with the employee.
- The plan may include phased hours, altered duties, or temporary workload reductions.
- Check‑ins will be scheduled to monitor workload, performance, and wellbeing during the first weeks after return.

8. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES
This policy works together with:
- Mental Health and Wellness Policy
- Burnout Prevention Policy
- Flexible Work and Work‑Life Balance Policy
- Relevant local leave and labor laws

Where there is conflict between this policy and legal requirements, the law prevails.
