EMPLOYEE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS POLICY
Version: 3.1
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources
Classification: Company‑Wide Policy

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy defines how the company supports employee mental health and psychological wellbeing. It covers prevention, support services, manager responsibilities, confidentiality, crisis support, and return‑to‑work practices. It applies to all employees, regardless of role, level, or contract type.

2. CORE PRINCIPLES
- Mental health is treated with the same priority as physical health.
- Seeking help is encouraged and must not carry stigma or penalty.
- Information is confidential and shared strictly on a need‑to‑know basis.
- Managers share responsibility for building psychologically safe teams.
- Access to care must be timely, practical, and affordable where possible.

3. SUPPORT SERVICES
3.1 Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
The company funds a confidential EAP that includes:
- 24/7 phone and digital access
- Short‑term counseling (minimum 8 sessions per year)
- Crisis counseling with same‑ or next‑day access
- Support for immediate family members
- Referrals to long‑term care providers

The EAP is free to employees and does not require manager approval.

3.2 Counseling and Therapy
Where supported by local benefits, employees may access:
- Individual counseling (in‑person or virtual)
- Couples or family counseling
- Group programs for stress, anxiety, or grief
- Psychiatric consultation when clinically required

3.3 Digital Wellbeing Tools
The company may provide:
- Meditation and mindfulness apps
- Self‑guided programs for stress and sleep
- Webinars and workshops on resilience, coping skills, and mental health literacy
- Anonymous screening tools (e.g., stress, burnout, depression self‑checks)

4. PREVENTION AND WORK ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Psychological Safety
Leaders and managers must:
- Encourage honest discussion of workload, priorities, and stress
- Respond constructively when employees raise concerns
- Act on patterns of unreasonable workload or harmful behaviors

4.2 Work Design
Teams should:
- Use meetings intentionally and avoid unnecessary recurring calls
- Respect focus time where defined
- Avoid normalizing extended hours or “always on” expectations

4.3 Inclusive and Accessible Environment
The company will:
- Provide quiet or wellness spaces in larger offices where feasible
- Support ergonomic setups for office and remote work
- Consider reasonable adjustments for neurodiverse employees and those with mental health conditions

5. MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES
Managers must:
- Hold regular 1:1s that include wellbeing check‑ins
- Watch for early signs of strain (e.g., sudden performance drop, withdrawal, irritability, repeated errors)
- Initiate supportive conversations when concerns arise
- Refer employees to EAP and HR instead of attempting to “treat” issues themselves
- Coordinate practical work adjustments where appropriate

All managers will receive periodic training on:
- Recognizing warning signs
- Having difficult conversations
- Using available policies and resources
- Protecting confidentiality and privacy

6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY
- Mental health information is treated as sensitive medical data.
- EAP records are never shared with the company without explicit, written consent, except in imminent risk situations.
- HR stores any medical documentation separately from performance records.
- Managers receive only information needed to implement or manage work adjustments, not full clinical detail.

Employees are not required to disclose diagnoses. They may share only what is necessary to request accommodations.

7. ACCOMMODATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS
Employees may request mental‑health‑related accommodations, such as:
- Temporary flexible or reduced hours
- Adjusted workload or deadlines
- Modified duties or environment changes
- Additional breaks or quiet time
- Hybrid or remote work where the role allows

Requests are handled through an interactive process involving the employee, manager, and HR. Decisions will consider legal obligations, role requirements, and operational impact.

8. CRISIS SUPPORT
If an employee appears to be in acute distress or at risk of self‑harm:
- Prioritize immediate safety and contact emergency services where needed.
- Notify HR as soon as practicable.
- Encourage the employee to contact the EAP or a crisis hotline when safe to do so.

After a crisis, HR will coordinate:
- Short‑term leave or schedule adjustments where appropriate
- A private debrief and return‑to‑work plan
- Guidance for managers and teams on respectful follow‑up

9. RETURN‑TO‑WORK AFTER MENTAL HEALTH LEAVE
When an employee returns from mental‑health‑related leave:
- HR will facilitate a confidential return‑to‑work discussion.
- Adjustments may include phased hours, reduced workload, or temporary role changes.
- The manager will schedule regular check‑ins for at least 8–12 weeks.
- Any required medical documentation will be handled according to local law and privacy rules.

10. GOVERNANCE AND REVIEW
HR owns this policy and reviews it at least every two years, or sooner if laws, benefits, or organizational needs change.
